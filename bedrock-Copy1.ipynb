      "response=Choosing a first programming language for high school students is a significant decision that can shape their enthusiasm for coding and set the foundation for future learning. Here are the pros and cons of Python versus Golang as a first choice:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Python\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ease of Learning**: Python is known for its simple and readable syntax, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners. The straightforward code can help students grasp basic programming concepts without getting bogged down by complex syntax.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Community and Resources**: Python has a vast community and a wealth of educational resources, tutorials, and books aimed at beginners. This makes it easier for students to find help when they encounter difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Versatility**: Python is used in a wide range of applications including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. This versatility can motivate students by showing them the many paths they can explore with Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Interactive Environment**: Python’s interactive shell allows students to write and execute code immediately, which can provide instant feedback and make learning more engaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Libraries and Frameworks**: Python has many beginner-friendly libraries and frameworks such as `Pandas` for data analysis and `Django` or `Flask` for web development that can be very appealing to students.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Performance**: Python is an interpreted language and generally slower than compiled languages like Go. This might not be a concern for beginners but could be a drawback as they delve deeper into performance-critical applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Memory Management**: Python handles memory management automatically, which might not teach students the fundamentals of how memory is managed in more low-level languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Golang (Go)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Go has a simpler syntax compared to many other languages, which can make it approachable for beginners. The language focuses on simplicity and reducing complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Concurrency Support**: Go has built-in support for concurrent programming, which can be a fascinating topic for students to learn early on. Go’s goroutines make it relatively easy to write concurrent code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Performance**: Go is a compiled language, which generally results in faster and more efficient programs. This could be an excellent motivation for students interested in performance optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Strong Typing**: Go has a strong and static type system, which can help students understand type safety and the importance of correct data types\n",

    "\n",
    "As you would have seen that different models we tried abovew have very different latencies. The latency and the quality of the output (along with the dollar cost of course) is critical in deciding which model to use for which task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a bar chart for visualizing model latencies.\n",
    "1. Color code the bar chart by model families i.e. the bars for the Claude models are in one color, LLama models in another color and so on and so forth.\n",
    "1. Save the plot in a file called `problem1_task3.png`. **Commit and push this file to repo**.\n",
    "1. Write a couple of lines of description in the notebook itself as to what is your interpretation from this chart that you created."
